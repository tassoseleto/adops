# Domain Docs

How the engineering skills should consume this repo's domain documentation when exploring the codebase.

## Before exploring, read these

- **`GLOSSARY.md`** at the repo root — domain vocabulary for ad arbitrage (RPS, CPC, Match Rate, EPMV, LFT, etc.)
- **`docs/adr/`**: read ADRs that touch the area you're about to work in.

If any of these files don't exist, **proceed silently**. The `/domain-modeling` skill (reached via `/grill-with-docs`) creates them lazily when terms or decisions get resolved.

## File structure

Single-context repo:

```
/
├── GLOSSARY.md
├── docs/adr/
│   └── 0001-*.md
└── src/
```

## Use the glossary's vocabulary

When your output names a domain concept (in an issue title, a refactor proposal, a hypothesis, a test name), use the term as defined in `GLOSSARY.md`. Don't drift to synonyms the glossary explicitly avoids.

## Flag ADR conflicts

If your output contradicts an existing ADR, surface it explicitly rather than silently overriding.
